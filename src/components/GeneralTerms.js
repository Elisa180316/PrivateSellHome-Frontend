          Registering and using the services of Privatesellhome implies
          compliance with and acceptance of all these General Conditions and
          Terms of Services, as well as any modifications and/or updates
          thereof. Registration on the portal and the consequent status of User
          is strictly NOT permitted for Real Estate Agencies, Real Estate
          Brokerage Firms or Real Estate Operators, whether independent or
          belonging to companies. The use of the services of Privatesellhome as
          well as any direct action within the portal is to be attributed
          exclusively to the status of User and clearly manifests itself in the
          possibility for the latter to create customizable announcements for
          the sale or rental of real estate and publish them on the portal of
          casetraprivati.it, making them freely accessible by third parties but
          receiving contact requests only and exclusively from third parties
          having the same status of User. The registration and use of
          Privatesellhome Services will allow casetraprivati.it to share user
          data and the content of announcements for the sale or lease of real
          estate published on the portal with partner companies for the sole
          purpose of making advantageous offers to the User. Privatesellhome's
          services include a vast range of proposals, the fundamentals of which
          include: sending alerts, reports and reminders to the User's mailbox,
          as well as publishing two advertisements with no time limit. The
          services just mentioned are free; however, the use of some Accessory
          Services (read the Specific Terms and Conditions of the Services) is
          subject to economic performance. All the contents, characteristics,
          methods of delivery and use of the Privatesellhome Services, including
          the Accessory Services, are decided exclusively by casetraprivati.it,
          which can make all the changes and/or additions and/or cancellations
          it deems more appropriate. The use of the services of Privatesellhome
          is limited to adults only. The User undertakes to correctly and
          truthfully locate his advertisement geographically and assumes full
          and complete responsibility in relation to the insertion of data for
          each of his advertisements. Pursuant to the provisions of art.
          13-quater of the Legislative Decree no. 34/2019 (converted into Law n.
          58/2019) and by the regional legislation on the subject, the User
          hereby undertakes to indemnify casetraprivati.it from any liability
          and/or prejudice possibly suffered in relation to the failure to
          comply with part of the User of the obligations referred to in this
          article as well as any applicable law or regulation. The User of
          Casetraprivati.it undertakes to make appropriate use of the Services
          offered by the site without employing them for (A) illegal activities,
          (B) contrary to good faith or criminal acts, (C) harmful to the rights
          of third parties and/or regulations that violate intellectual property
          and/or any other rule of the legal system, or (D) of direct or
          indirect commercial exploitation. The User will always hold
          Casetraprivati.it harmless from any possible prejudicial consequence,
          whether direct or indirect, deriving from the violation of the
          aforementioned obligations. Furthermore, the User acknowledges and
          accepts that the use of the Privatesellhome Services is at his own
          exclusive risk and under his responsibility. Without prejudice to the
          provisions of paragraph 5, access to the Privatesellhome Services may
          be revoked without notice or in any case subject to temporary and/or
          definitive restrictions, if the User has not complied with the
          provisions contained in these General Conditions. In any case, when
          using the Case Tra Privati Services, the User is absolutely forbidden
          to reproduce, modify in any form, distribute, and, in general, make
          available to third parties any material and/or information (such as,
          by way of example but not limited to, photographs, drawings, logos,
          trademarks, etc.) protected by industrial and intellectual property
          rights of casetraprivati.it or third parties. Considering that the
          correct visualization and/or consultation of all or part of the
          contents created by the User through the Privatesellhome Services
          (whether they are fundamental or accessories), depends on factors over
          which casetraprivati.it has no type of control (e.g. bad or
          non-functioning of the internet and/or of the hardware and software
          used by the User), the latter cannot in any way be held responsible
          for the incomplete and/or non-use by the User and/or third parties of
          the content created through the services of privatesellhome.it.
