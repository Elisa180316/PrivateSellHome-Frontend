              TYPES OF VILLA: HERE ARE THE MAIN TYPES AND HOW TO CHOOSE THE
              RIGHT ONE!
            </h3>
            <p>
            
              Villas are a very sought-after type of home, especially for those
              looking for large and comfortable spaces, surrounded by greenery
              and away from the chaos of the city. There are different types of
              villas, each with particular characteristics that make it suitable
              for different needs and tastes. Let's see some of them: Single
              villa: it is a villa independent from other houses, usually
              surrounded by a private garden and equipped with large internal
              and external spaces. The single villa is the most requested type
              of villa, as it guarantees maximum privacy and tranquillity.
              Semi-detached villa: it is a villa made up of two separate
              residential units, but which share some common areas such as the
              entrance, the garden and the courtyard. The semi-detached villa is
              an ideal solution for families who want to live close together but
              maintaining their independence. Terraced villa: it is a villa
              which is spread over several floors and which shares one or two
              sides with other similar villas, but which are in any case
              independent. The terraced villa is the ideal solution for those
              looking for large spaces but do not want to give up the
              convenience of being close to their neighbours. Luxury villa: it
              is a highly prestigious villa, often equipped with exclusive
              services such as a spa, a gym, a home theater, and a breathtaking
              panoramic view. The luxury villa is the ideal solution for those
              who want to live in an exclusive and luxurious environment. Style
              villa: it is a villa built in a particular architectural style,
              such as the neoclassical style villa or the Mediterranean style
              villa. The style villa is the ideal solution for those who love
              refined environments with a unique charm. In addition to
              residential villas, there are also holiday villas, or villas used
              to welcome guests for holidays or short stays. Also in this case,
              there are different types of holiday villas, suitable to satisfy
              the different needs of tourists. Read also House rental by the
              sea: how does the tourist contract work? Read also Short-term
              rentals: excellent for holidays (and as an investment) Villa with
              sea view: it is a villa located in a panoramic position
              overlooking the sea. The villa with sea view is the ideal solution
              for those who love the sea and want to enjoy a spectacular view
              from their home. Villa in the countryside: it is a villa
              surrounded by nature, far from the chaos of the city and equipped
              with outdoor spaces to enjoy the tranquility of the countryside.
              The villa in the countryside is the ideal solution for those who
              want to spend their holidays in a relaxing and healthy
              environment. Villa with swimming pool: even the holiday villas can
              be equipped with a private swimming pool to spend moments of
              relaxation and fun without having to leave the house. The villa
              with swimming pool is the ideal solution for those who want to
              spend their holidays in complete freedom and privacy. Villa by the
              sea: it is a villa located near the sea, which allows you to enjoy
              the beach and the sea without having to move too much. The seaside
              villa is the ideal solution for those who want to spend their
              holidays on the beach and enjoy the beauty of the sea. Villa with
              garden: it is a villa with large outdoor spaces such as a private
              garden, patio or veranda, which allow you to enjoy the mild
              climate and the surrounding landscape. The villa with garden is
              the ideal solution for those who want to spend their holidays in
              the open air and in contact with nature. In short, villas in
              general offer multiple possibilities for a stay, depending on
              everyone's needs and tastes. The choice of the holiday villa
              depends on the holiday destination, the activities you want to do
              and the budget available, but one thing is certain: spending your
              holidays in a villa is an unforgettable and relaxing experience.

        <h3 className="text-primary">HOUSES TOO EMPTY OR TOO FULL: THAT'S WHY THEY ARE A PROBLEM FOR SALE.</h3>
        <p>One of the problems that are most encountered in the tortuous process of
        selling a property, especially as a private individual, is how to be
        sure that you have emotionally involved the potential buyer to the
        maximum. Often the houses do not present themselves in the best way in
        the initial phase: they are too empty (therefore cold) or decidedly too
        full (therefore chaotic, confusing and unable to reveal their real
        potential) with the risk of alienating the curiosity of possible
        interested parties. The perceptive aspect is fundamental in the process
        of presenting a property: the more you are able to involve the potential
        buyer, the greater the chances of success. In this regard, let's see how
        best to orient yourself in the two cases: empty house and full house
        with two techniques that respond exactly to these problems: home staging
        (empty house) and decluttering (full house). We talk about it with
        Serena Motta, now a Home Stager with consolidated experience in the
        field of event organization, who has seen and set up many spaces. Yes,
        because selling a house has a lot to do with setting up and putting the
        best out of your property. Empty house and full house: two true stories
        to understand how to act to sell. Empty house (as an owner). Years ago,
        Serena says, I was in charge of an event location in Milan: an all-white
        loft with a view of red brick buildings: it felt like being in New York!
        The space was entirely empty and (exactly as happens for the sale of a
        house), during the inspection the customers with slightly frightened
        eyes - wondered how they could ever imagine the space once set up. Here
        is the problem: the client could not imagine what the environment could
        have become! The space was too empty and although my ability to appeal
        to the imagination was engaging, the lack of real references didn't help
        me: I needed to give concreteness to the words by showing installations
        that I could touch. The same problem that I encountered and still
        encounter today in the real estate sector: fortunately in this case Home
        Staging helps me: a technique that has the specific objective of filling
        in the empty spaces with concreteness given by a temporary physical
        set-up that allows the client not only to have an idea, but to
        concretely visualize how the house could become once furnished. The
        visual and realistic impact is much more significant than a mere story.
        Furniture, furnishing accessories and objects are brought from scratch
        into the empty apartment, and arranged to make it pleasant, attractive
        and immediately understandable. Home Staging is therefore mainly
        recommended for empty or semi-furnished apartments. Overfilled house (as
        a buyer). Last year I started looking for a house myself; it was an
        exhausting search: most of the real estate ads had demotivating
        photographs (crooked, blurry, taken with a mobile phone, in the dark,
        the house in a complete messâ€¦). After having identified a property of
        interest to me, I organize a visit to this house still inhabited by the
        current owners. Entering the apartment, a sense of oppression pervades
        me: the house is saturated with family objects. A thousand toys on the
        floor, a clothes horse dominates the middle of the living room, there
        are dishes to wash in the kitchen. At the end of the visit I had seen
        practically nothing of the apartment: I was completely distracted by the
        surroundings. The house was too full of the life of the current
        owners.Having experienced it firsthand, I'm sure that situations like
        this determine (or greatly prolong) the sale of a property. As with
        empty spaces, even in the case of apartments saturated with objects, it
        becomes difficult and almost impossible to imagine how a home could be
        transformed according to our wishes. I am equally certain that very
        little would have been enough to improve the situation and help keep
        alive the interest I had nurtured during the selection and request for a
        visit. In this case, the decluttering technique is ideal and has a few
        simple rules that have the precise aim of highlighting the potential of
        the house. to. Make environments neutral: away with personal items,
        photographs, family heirlooms b. Tidy up and clean up: the rooms must
        seem spacious, airy, bright c. Enhance: enhance the positive aspects of
        the apartment, giving value to a few elements â€“ already present in the
        house â€“ which harmonize with each other.
